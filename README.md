# horiseon-refactor
#UserStory

First time code refactoring. I learned a lot from this exercise, especially about consolidating classes in CSS. 
I am in UCLA extension Bootcamp, in hopes of becoming a efficient programmer

## Description
Basically this repository had a lot of duplicate of code that needed to be changed. At first I thought the 
code was fine. Since the web page pulled up exactly like the mockup. Learning later with a study buddy, who was credited 
for helping me out during about 5 hour straight session. We both realized the issue with .header

#Changes Made
* Added title stating the name of the company 
* Added semantic tags change div(s) to nav in header 
* Added alt text for images
* Consolidated repetitive css 
* Fixed missing id to make menu link work correctly
* Commented HTML and CSS for readability and clarity


#Credits
* Chris Patronite
